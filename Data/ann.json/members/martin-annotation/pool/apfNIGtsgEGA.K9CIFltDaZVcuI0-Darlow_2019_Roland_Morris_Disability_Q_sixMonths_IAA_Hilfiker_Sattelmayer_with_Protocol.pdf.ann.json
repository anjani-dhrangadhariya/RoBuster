All results will be reported as estimates of eﬀect size (e.g. mean diﬀerence, risk ratio, number needed to treat [NNT]) with   % confidence intervals (  % CI). All analyses will be conducted on an intention to treat basis.\n\nAnalyses will also account for clustering of data. For the patient-level outcomes, this clustering will be specified at the GP level – while randomisation is at the practice level. For the GP level outcomes, clustering will be specified at the practice level. The stratified nature of the randomisation schedule will be handled by including the practice size stratum identifier in analytical models (less than or equal to   FTE GPs, greater than   FTE GPs).\n\nPrimary patient outcome\n\nThe primary analysis will follow an intention to treat approach and compare mean RMDQ scores at  months between the intervention and control arms using a linear mixed model (adjusted for baseline RMDQ as a second fixed eﬀect). This model will also be adjusted for other factors known to aﬀect the outcome: age, gender, socioeconomic status, current back pain duration and nature (constant or episodic), receipt of recent or ongoing non-GP health care for back pain, previous history of back pain, baseline pain intensity, and baseline beliefs about back pain (self-eﬃcacy and expectation, fear avoidance). The analysis will also adjust for baseline HC-PAIRS scores as measured at the level of the GP (as a measure of baseline treatment competence). This adjustment will improve the precision of the intervention eﬀect estimate, and will also serve to improve handling of missing follow-up data.\n\nA random eﬀect for GP will be used to account for the clustered nature of the data. Linear mixed models will be used to reduce bias due to incomplete follow-up: in this case, data from the  w,  w, and  m follow- up times will be included in the model when estimating diﬀerences at  m to allow for missing data at this final end point. The relative risk of a   % improvement in RMDQ scores will be reported, along with the numbers needed to treat (NNT) to achieve this target. As a sensitivity analysis, the NNT and RR of a  . point absolute reduction in RMDQ score will also be reported (in line with the absolute eﬀect size stipulated for the primary outcome).\n\nSubgroup analysis will compare mean RMDQ scores at   months using the same model as the primary outcome for those who presented with a new episode of acute back pain of less than   weeks duration who had not received health care for back pain in the previous three months."}],"coordinates":[{"x":"180.21","y":"413.75"},{"x":"460.12","y":"745.41"}],"confidence":{"state":"pre-added","who":["user:martin-annotation"],"prob":1},"fields":{},"normalizations":{}}],"relations":[]}
