Abstract

Background

The insertion of filiform needles intramuscularly (a.k.a. intramuscular stimulation/dry nee- dling) has been suggested as a possible treatment for various painful musculoskeletal con- ditions. Our aim was to answer the question, is intramuscular stimulation more effective than sham intramuscular stimulation/dry needling for the treatment of Achilles tendinopathy?

Methods

52 participants with persistent midportion Achilles tendinopathy began and 46 completed one of three treatment protocols which were randomly assigned: (G3) a 12-week rehabilita- tion program of progressive tendon loading plus intramuscular stimulation (n = 25), (G2) the same rehabilitation program but with sham intramuscular stimulation (n = 19), or (G1) a ref- erence group of rehabilitation program alone (as an additional control) (n = 8). The a priori primary outcome measure was change in VISA-A score at 12 weeks–VISA-A was also mea- sured at 6 weeks, and at 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcome measures include the pro- portion of patients who rated themselves as much or very much improved (%), dorsiflexion range of motion (degrees), and tendon thickness (mm).

Results

The study retention was 94% at 12 weeks and 88% at 1 year. VISA-A score improved in all three groups over time (p&lt;0.0001), with no significant difference among the three groups in

VISA-A score at the start of the study (mean ± SD: G3 59 ± 13, G2 57 ± 17, G1 56 ± 22), at

12 weeks (G3 76 ± 14, G2 76 ± 15, G1 82 ± 11) or at any other timepoint. The percentage of patients who rated themselves as much or very much improved (i.e. treatment success) was not different after 12 weeks (G3 70%, G2 89%, G1 86% p = 0.94), or at 26 (p = 0.62) or

Conclusion

The addition of intramuscular stimulation to standard rehabilitation for Achilles tendinopathy did not result in any improvement over the expected clinical benefit achieved with exercise- based rehabilitation alone.

Introduction

Mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is accompanied by pain and impaired function in the

Achilles tendon [1]. It is typically accompanied by structural changes visible on ultrasound such as thickening of the tendon, a feature which is present early in the development of pathol- ogy [2]. The pain of Achilles tendinopathy may be accompanied by altered central nervous sys- tem processing, such as reduced conditioned pain modulation and mechanical secondary hyperalgesia [3, 4] although others have argued that Achilles tendinopathy pain is primarily driven by peripheral nociception [5] perhaps as a result of local nociceptive substances [2, 6].

Achilles tendinopathy is common in runners, with a recent cohort study reporting a 24% incidence among runners [7]; in that study, years of activity and weekly mileage were identi- fied as risk factors, although not all studies have found such associations [8]. In another study, the cumulative incidence of Achilles tendinopathy was 24% in former elite athletes from vari- ous sports (running, athletics, soccer, hockey, etc) compared to 5.9% in matched controls [9].

The prognosis of Achilles tendinopathy is variable; in club-level adult and youth athletes, the median time to return to play from Achilles tendinopathy was 1.7–12.5 days, with an upper range of 30 days [10]. Others have reported that ongoing symptoms are present 5 years later in over a third of recreationally active adults who enrolled in a clinical trial [11].

Current recommended treatment for those with persistent Achilles tendinopathy empha- sizes tendon-loading exercises and activity modification/education [1, 12] with eventual refer- ral to surgery for severe long-standing cases [13, 14]. Placebo-controlled studies of proposed adjunct treatments such as shockwave therapy [15–17] or topical glyceryl trinitrate [18, 19] have not clearly demonstrated a benefit for Achilles tendinopathy, showing small improve- ments [16], improvements reported by a single study [19], or no apparent benefit [15, 17, 18].

There are very few placebo-controlled studies of injection therapies [20–26] or analgesics

(either topical [27] or oral [28]) to inform clinical decision-making.

The insertion of filiform needles (FNs) intramuscularly, a.k.a. intramuscular stimulation

(IMS), has been suggested as a possible treatment for Achilles tendinopathy [29]. Gunn et al

[30] suggested that, in people with Achilles tendinopathy, the gastrocnemius and soleus mus- cles may become “shortened” (i.e demonstrate reduced extensibility) and deliver excessive mechanical stress to the Achilles tendon. They suggested that this muscle shortening may result from the formation of taut bands (sustained contraction in localised sections of the mus- cles), and that the insertion of FNs into these taut bands can assist in relaxing them, restoring their extensibility and thereby normal mechanical loading of the tendon. They also suggested that local gastrocnemius and soleus muscle banding/shortening may often be accompanied by muscle banding/shortening in other muscles that share the same segmental nerve supply as the gastrocnemius, soleus and Achilles tendon, i.e. L5-S2. They hypothesised that the reason for this may be neuropathic dysfunction in the affected segments [31].

          <pre id="s3v1">There is great variability in the way FNs are used to treat musculoskeletal pain both in prac- tice and in research settings, and there is no research on the use of FNs intramuscularly to treat Achilles tendinopathy. For other conditions, such as chronic low back pain, it has been suggested that dry needling may be a useful adjunct treatment, however further high quality studies are needed [32]. There is only one published study that uses a needle insertion approach to treat Achilles tendinopathy, conducted by Zhang et al [33], but it is unclear where the FNs were inserted (skin, muscle, tendon etc) and the conclusion of the study (that the effect of acupuncture-style needling on pain and function was superior to exercise) may be ques- tioned. In their 2016 systematic review Cox et al [34] rated the study by Zhang et al as having a low risk of bias, however the acupuncture group (1) was not blinded, (2) was not compared to a sham group, and (3) received 24 visits over 8 weeks compared to apparently a single visit in the exercise group, which achieved lower-than-expected outcomes for exercise-based treat- ment [33]. Thus, there is very minimal evidence on which to base a recommendation for the use of dry needling of any kind in people with chronic Achilles tendinopathy.

The primary purpose of this study was to compare the clinical status of people with Achilles tendinopathy who receive IMS (G3) to those who receive sham needling (G2); a reference group (G1) received no needling. To our knowledge, this is the first placebo/sham controlled randomized controlled trial of an intramuscular dry needling technique for Achilles tendinopathy.

Methods

Study design

This was a parallel, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial at a single site: the University of

British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada). A single investigator (LS) provided all treatments.

Three treatment and data collection locations were used: the Centre for Hip and Health Mobil- ity at Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute (Vancouver), Kinetic Rehabilitation Centre

(North Vancouver), and Canopy Integrated Health (North Vancouver). Patients were recruited by placing advertisements in public locations, local newspapers, and a Facebook page, and an entry in the Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute trial database and news- letter. All patients provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the UBC

Clinical Research Ethics Board (H12-02008). The trial was registered and kept up to date at

ISCRTN.com (70177540). As described below in the section on enrolment, the study took place in two phases but with identical outcome measures such that the data set could be com- bined and analyzed as a whole.

Participants

Inclusion criteria were; 19 to 60 years of age, fluent in English, minimum symptom duration of 3 months, evidence of midportion Achilles tendinopathy on physical examination, i.e. pain location isolated to the mid-portion of the Achilles tendon and progressive loading causing increasing pain (double leg toe-raise, single leg toe-raise, jump, hop, hop for height, hop for distance), and indications by Gunn IMS assessment of neuropathic change in the L5-S2 seg- mental levels including the presence of taut muscle bands amenable to IMS. Exclusion criteria were; IMS contraindications (infection in the area, pregnancy, bleeding disorders, history of bacterial endocarditis, post-surgical implant in the past four to six months, major surgery in the last three months), previous treatment with intramuscular dry needling (for blinding pur- poses), true leg length difference of greater than ½”, systemic inflammatory disease, previous corticosteroid injections, recent fluoroquinolone use, and the presence of other syndromes

Age, gender, symptom duration and physical activity level (International Physical Activity

Questionnaire) were recorded at visit 1.

Enrolment and randomization

After informed consent was obtained, and before any clinical assessment or baseline data col- lection, participants were randomized by a study coordinator who had no role in the initial assessment or treatment. The study coordinator was provided with a simple (unblocked, unbalanced) random allocation sequence with 42 allocations into three groups, generated by the primary investigator (AS) using a random sequence generator (Microsoft Excel). This list was used to allocate the first 21 participants (recruited from April 2013 to April 2014) into G3,

G2 or G1 conditions. In summer of 2014, an amendment to the protocol was submitted to the funder, ethics board and trial registry such that further allocations would be only to the G3 and G2 groups to focus on the primary question—comparison between IMS and sham nee- dling. Thereafter a revised (unblocked, unbalanced) random allocation sequence with a further

42 allocations was generated. The remaining participants were recruited and allocated to G3 or G2 fromOctober 2014 –December 2018. The same research assistant assigned participants to groups sequentially as they enrolled using the random allocation sequence and notified the researcher administering the interventions (LS) of participants group allocation just prior to their first treatment session. Only AS and a research assistant not involved in participant inter- vention or assessments had access to the random allocation sequence.

Blinding

Participants assigned to a needling group were blinded to their group allocation (IMS or sham

IMS) until after having received their nine treatments and completed their 12-week outcome measures. It was not possible to blind the treating therapist (LS) to participant group alloca- tion. Those assessing ankle range measures were blinded to group allocation. Ultrasound scans were taken by LS and interpretation of ultrasounds was performed by a research assistant blinded to group allocation. After 12 weeks, participants who received needling were asked which group they thought they were assigned to, and their answer was categorized as correct or incorrect.

Important changes to methods after trial commencement (such as eligibility criteria), with reasons

Initially, prior experience with Traditional Chinese Medicine Acupuncture was an exclusion criterion. This was removed prior to the start of recruitment (in April 2013) as it was seen as potentially an undue hindrance to recruitment. After enrolment of the first 21 participants, we amended the allocation ratio (as described above) to focus on the primary question (difference in outcome between IMS (G3) and sham IMS (G2) groups by making no further allocations to the exercise-only reference group (G1).

Interventions

All participants (G3, G2, G1) received a standardised 12-week physiotherapy program pro- vided by one of the investigators (LS), including a progressive isometric, concentric and eccen- tric training and kinetic chain strengthening program. All groups were prescribed the same standardised exercise programme designed to initially maintain (as pain allowed) and then, as

The programme was progressive, and eccentric loading of gastrocnemius-soleus-Achilles ten- don complex loading was incorporated throughout. The first phase focused on isometric load- ing, the second on concentric and then load, range and speed were gradually increased [5].

Participants were progressed based on a “twenty-four-hour response” to exercise, specifically, there was not to be increased pain or stiffness the morning after undertaking the exercise, how- ever pain during exercise was allowed. Participants were advised to keep the discomfort during activities of daily living to a level of no more than 5/10 on a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is no pain at all and 10 is the worst possible imaginable pain. Participants filled out a training diary–the number of sessions completed was calculated as a percentage of prescribed sessions.

G3—The IMS treatment group received intramuscular dry needling treatment (APS Dry

Needling Needles by Agupunt; Barcelona, Spain; 0.25–0.30 x 25-75mm) once a week for the first six weeks of the trial and once every two weeks for the remainder, resulting in nine treat- ments overall. The choice of needle insertion points was individualised for each participant based on their assessment findings and using the neuropathic model approach described by

Dr. C. Chan Gunn [31]. This approach considers the potential contribution of a dysfunctional nervous system to myofascial pain syndromes, and in the case of Achilles tendinopathy with a particular focus on treating dysfunction in the L5-S2 segments. Treatment involved the inser- tion of FNs into taut muscle bands (as palpated by the treating therapist) in both the spinal region and the lower limbs.

G2—The sham IMS group, received eight FNs (APS Dry Needling Needles by Agupunt;

Barcelona, Spain; 0.25 x 25mm) that were inserted superficially (1–2 mmmaximum depth) in the buttock, posterior thigh and calf regions and were left in situ for ten minutes. The schedule and number of visits was the same as for G3. To avoid mimicking either IMS or purported

TCMA effects: needles were inserted away from any taut muscle bands that were palpated by

LS and were inserted superficially so that no muscle penetration occurred; purported TCMA meridians in the treatment area and TCMA points used to treat heel pain specifically were avoided; and it was ensured that no “deqi” sensation was elicited (i.e. aching, soreness, pres- sure) [35].

G1 –This reference group (actively allocated only during the first portion of the study period, as described above) only received the exercise program. This intervention group was included as an additional, internal reference primarily to ensure that the exercise program was performing as expected.

Outcome measures

The outcome measures were designed and registered prior to the publication of a recent con- sensus on outcome measures [36]. There were no changes to outcome measures after registra- tion of the protocol at ISCRTN, although we did alter the ultrasound analysis from what was described in our ethics protocol by focusing on tendon thickness rather than echo texture. The primary outcome for which the study was powered was the change from baseline in 12 week

VISA-A (Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment–Achilles), a valid and reliable disease-spe- cific outcome measure [37] which also includes an activity-related pain scale. The VISA-A score was also measured at 6, 26 and 52 weeks.

Other secondary outcome measures were included a priori:

(1) A written, 7-point, patient-rated Likert scale of Global Rating of Change (GROC) was filled in by patients, from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Ratings of “very much improved” or “much improved” were considered as treatment success (6, 12, 26, 52 weeks).

          <pre id="s6v1">(2) Dorsiflexion range of motion was measured in two weightbearing positions (knee bent or straight) using an inclinometer placed midway along the anterior surface of the tibia (weeks

0, 12 and 52) [38]. Prior to measurement, participants performed stretches in a standing lunge with the middle of the heel and the second toe aligned in a straight line, with both the back knee straight and the back knee bent (15 second stretch, five times each). Range of motion was measured by one of two physiotherapy assessors who were both blind to treatment allocation.

(3) Tendon thickness in the antero-posterior plane at the point of maximal tendon thicken- ing was measured using grey-scale B-mode ultrasound images (weeks 0, 6, 12, 26 and 52). Par- ticipants lay prone on an examination bed with their foot positioned and stabilised by the person taking the scan such that the tendon was “flat” (i.e. lay passively straight) to achieve a perpendicular alignment between the Achilles tendon and the UTC transducer (Smartprobe

10L5; Terason 2000, Teratech, USA; UTC Technologies, Oldemarkt, Netherlands), i.e. in an individual-specific degree of dorsiflexion. The transducer (in its tracker) was positioned and stabilised by the person taking the scan so that the centre of the ultrasound head was placed over the centre of the posteromedial aspect of the tendon (the region most commonly affected by Achilles tendinopathy) to allow the ultrasound beam to interface with this region at a per- pendicular angle. Once the foot and transducer were fixed in position, adjacent transverse images (2D) of the AT were automatically captured at every 0.2 mm for 12 cm along the ten- don axis and compiled to create a 3D scan for tomographic visualization in the transverse, sag- ittal, and coronal planes. Each subsequent scan was obtained using the same method. The ultrasound probe was a Smartprobe 10L5 (Terason 2000, Teratech, USA) attached to an Ultra- sound Tissue Characterization tracking system (UTC Technologies, Oldemarkt, Netherlands).

Transverse images (2D) of the AT were automatically captured every 0.2 mm for 12 cm along the tendon axis and compiled to create a 3D scan for tomographic visualization in the trans- verse, sagittal, and coronal planes. Scans were de-identified and analyzed with blinding of the time point and participant ID. To analyze the scans, the site of maximal thickening was identi- fied at week 0. The same location was used for all subsequent measures by measuring caudally from the calcaneal insertion.

Sample size calculation

We assumed that the change in VISA-A from 0 to 12 weeks with exercise alone would be 20 points [37], with a normal distribution and a standard deviation of 12 [23]. We assumed the minimum clinically important difference in VISA-A score to be 12 points [37]. Given these assumptions, to answer the primary question, the trial was powered (at 0.80, with alpha of

0.05) to detect a difference of 12 points between the G3 (IMS) and G2 (sham needling) groups, which for an independent t-test would require a sample size of 16 in each group.

Statistical analysis and treatment of missing data

Statistical analysis was conducted in R 3.6.0. Data are presented to 2 significant figures with the standard deviation (SD) in parentheses. For the primary and secondary outcome measures, an independent blinded statistical analysis was conducted by a professional statistician. For the main outcome measure (VISA-A), linear modeling was employed to incorporate the repeated nature of the measurements. For the primary endpoint of VISA-A, we used a model of VISA- time = αSUBJECT+VISAbaseline�group+log(time)+�time. The covariance structure was Cor- relation(�t1,�t2) = ϕ|t1−t2|, to account for the fact that the longer the time interval between two observations, the weaker their correlation is. We also tested for interactions between group and time, and between baseline VISA and group. The same modelling process and covariance structure was used for dorsiflexion range of motion (both bent and straight knee)

All available data for all patients who received their allocated treatment were included in the analysis, regardless of whether their data set was complete. All patients were analyzed according to their allocated treatment (i.e. intention to treat). We did not impute or replace any missing values but rather fitted all the available data to the model.

Actual, not modelled, data are presented. An interim analysis was planned at the midpoint of recruitment, and this was conducted slightly ahead of schedule after the first 18 subjects were enrolled, in order to support release of further grant funds.

Results

Participants

Recruitment began in April 2013 and was completed in December 2018. The trial was stopped because the target sample size for G2 and G3 were achieved. Fifty-two participants were allo- cated into 3 groups (Fig 1) which were demographically and clinically similar (Table 1).

Thirty-one (60%) participants identified running as the likely mechanism of injury to their

Achilles tendon. Other reported mechanisms of injury were walking (7, 13%), jumping (3,

6%), soccer (3, 6%), hiking (2, 4%), basketball (1, 2%), bus driving (1, 2%), swing dancing (1,

2%), squash (1, 2%) and tennis (1, 2%). Twenty participants (64% of runners) had stopped running due to their Achilles pain. On entry to the study, 24 participants were walking for exercise, 2 were hiking, 13 were running, 1 per activity were still participating in soccer, bas- ketball, bus driving and swing dancing.

Success of blinding

At 12 weeks, when asked to state what group they thought they were in, most participants had difficulty selecting one or the other group. There were three missing data points; two from G3 and one from G2. In G3, 81% of participants correctly guessed they received IMS. This is per- haps understandable because IMS typically elicits noticeable sensations. In G2, 67% of partici- pants correctly guessed they were in the sham needling group. Thus, the blinding may be said to be only partially successful.

Missing data

Most missing data were a result of participants’ leaving the study (ie, all subsequent measure- ments after a certain time point were missing), yielding a retention rate of 94% at 12 weeks and 88% at 1 year. After 1 year, the number of participants who had left the study were 2 (G3),

1 (G2), and 3 (G1). Missing tendon thickness values also occurred at a particular time point for 3 participants due to unusable or missing ultrasound scans: 1 at 6 weeks and 2 at 26 weeks.

GROC values were missing for a G3 participant at 26 weeks, but not at the other timepoints.

The linear modeling did not impute missing values but fitted all available data to the model.

All analysis was completed by the original assigned group.

Exercise compliance

Based on the information recorded by patients in the exercise diaries, the percentage of partici- pants who completed at least 75% of their prescribed exercise sessions was 83% (G3), 92%

(G2) and 100% (G1).

Secondary outcomes

The percentage of patients who rated themselves as much or very much improved (i.e. “treat- ment success”) was not significantly different at any timepoint (Table 2: 12 weeks, p = 0.94; 26 weeks, p = 0.62; 52 weeks, p = 0.71.). Pearson’s Chi-squared testing showed there was no sig- nificant difference in the distribution of GROC rating between Groups 1, 2 and 3 at any time point (Fig 3).

On the whole, the tendon thickness significantly decreased over 12 months regardless of group allocation (p&lt;0.01) (Table 2), despite that fact that there was a significant interaction between baseline value and group (p = 0.007) indicating a slight allocation bias for this out- come measure. Dorsiflexion range of motion did not differ between groups when measured either with the knee straight (p = 0.124) or bent (p = 0.474), and did not significantly improve

          <pre id="s11v1">twitch/contraction. Many in the IMS group also reported post-treatment soreness of variable intensity and duration. Both of these were expected treatment effects, and likely contributed to the difficulty in blinding to group allocation, as in contrast there was almost no sensation reported from needle insertion to the depth of the skin only in the sham IMS group–only the very occasional reporting of mild sharpness—and no reporting of post-treatment soreness.

When a sensation of sharpness on needle insertion occurred in either needling group, the nee- dle was immediately removed, and replaced at an adjacent site where no sharpness was elicited and left in situ in that location. As expected, occasional minor bruising resulted from some of the needle insertions in the IMS group. There were no severe adverse events reported (includ- ing pneumothorax, organ injury, nervous system injury or infection). No patient withdrew due to needling side effects.

Discussion

This study failed to demonstrate a greater improvement in symptoms of Achilles tendinopathy in patients who received IMS (intramuscular dry needling, using filiform needles) and exer- cise, compared either to sham IMS and exercise, or to exercise alone. The magnitude of improvement observed in all three groups in the primary outcome measure (VISA-A) was as expected, based on previous studies with similar exercise programs [39].

In some jurisdictions, intramuscular dry needling, including IMS, is widely used by physio- therapists and other health professionals as an adjunct treatment for tendinopathies and other conditions, with some support for conditions such as low back pain [32]. There is minimal evi- dence on whether this treatment technique (or other needle-based techniques such as acu- puncture) is effective for Achilles tendinopathy, or other tendinopathies.

A variety of theories have been advanced about the potential mechanisms whereby intra- muscular dry needling may influence musculoskeletal pain; however, since there did not appear to be an important clinical effect on Achilles tendon pain in this trial, we will not specu- late about potential treatment mechanisms here. Regarding the possible effect in this study of

IMS on muscle length, however, the main mechanism that has been proposed for this effect is the induction of a local twitch response (LTR). The LTR has been described as a reflex contrac- tion of the muscle fibres that form a taut band that can be elicited by inserting a needle into the band [40]. LTRs induced by intramuscular dry needling have been associated with the fol- lowing changes within muscles: a reduction in excess electrical activity [41], a reduction in local excess levels of the neurotransmitters Substance P and calcitonin gene related peptide

[42], and a reduction in mechanical hypersensitivity [43]. We did not document whether an

LTR occurred with intramuscular needle insertions in the IMS group in this study.

Another limitation is that we were not able to objectively measure one of the prescription parameters for the type of needling used here (presence of taut bands within muscles of the

L5-S1 segment). We recognise that a technology has not been developed that is able to identify or measure differences in hardness of different regions of muscle with the robustness required for a study of this kind, although shear wave elastography shows promise if the technology can be further refined. Nevertheless, manual therapists attest to the ability of the human sense of touch to palpate differences in hardness of different regions of the same muscle. This was the method used to determine the location for intramuscular needle insertions in this study, and we acknowledge this method as a limitation.

This study has some other limitations. Our sample size was relatively small, particularly for the exercise-only group which was mainly included as a reference group to ensure that the exercise program was performing similar to the reports. Our power calculation assumed that the standard deviation of the VISA-A score would be 12, and in fact it was 14. This indicates

          <pre id="s12v1">that for the primary outcome, the required sample size to detect a difference between sham and IMS needling (the main study question) was 22 per group, which was nearly met for G2 and G3. Thus, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the trial was under-powered, nevertheless it seems unlikely that including a few more participants in the sham IMS group would alter the observed mean improvement in VISA-A (G3, 18 (13); G2, 18(11)). An interest- ing finding is that blinding was only partially successful, and yet despite this a placebo effect was not observed for either needling group. The results of this study cannot be generalized to other patient populations such as elite athletes or those with insertional Achilles tendinopathy, or to patients who may be treated with needling alone rather than in combination with exercise.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the addition of intramuscular stimulation to standard rehabilitation for Achilles tendinopathy did not result in any improvement over the expected clinical benefit achieved with sham needling and exercise-based rehabilitation.

Plain English Summary

Background and study aims  The aim of this study is to find out whether Achilles tendon pain (tendinopathy) can be treated more effectively if a form of treatment called IMS (intramuscular stimulation) is added to the current standard treatment programme.

Who can participate?  Men and women between the ages of 19 and 60 who have pain in the area of the Achilles tendon. 

What does the study involve?  Participants will attend a screening assessment with a registered physiotherapist to find out if they are suitable for this study. If they are found to be suitable, they will then have an Ultrasound Tissue Characterisation Scan (UTC) image taken of the affected tendon. This scan will provide information on the structure of the tendon and will take about five minutes. Participants will also be asked to have another UTC scan after 6 weeks of treatment, at the end of the study (after 12 weeks of treatment), and at 12 months. Participants will be randomly placed into one of two groups. All participants will be asked to complete a set of exercises twice a day. Each set of exercises will take about five minutes to complete. Group 1 will receive the current standard of treatment for Achilles pain and receive IMS. Group 2 will receive the current standard of treatment and treatment that is like IMS but is not IMS (placebo). Participants will fill out a questionnaire which will take about 5 minutes to complete. This questionnaire will tell us how severe the tendon problem is. Participants will be asked to fill this questionnaire out five times: at the beginning of the study, before starting treatment, after 6 weeks of participation in the study, at the end of treatment (after 12 weeks of participation in the study), and one year after the beginning of the study, for long-term follow-up. Participants will have the amount of movement in the ankle measured by a physiotherapist three times - at the beginning of the study, after 6 weeks of participation in the study, and at the end of treatment and at 12 months. This will take about 5 minutes each time. All participants will attend nine physiotherapy visits over 12 weeks. Each visit will take about 45 minutes and they will be spread out so that the first six visits are about one week apart and the last three visits are about two weeks apart. The physiotherapist will teach the tendon exercises and check that these exercises are being performed correctly. </pre>

What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?  No matter which group participants are allocated to, they will be provided with the current standard of care for Achilles pain which has a 60-80% success rate. If allocated to the IMS-like group, participants would be expected to have similar results. If allocated to the IMS group, participants may or may not derive extra benefit from IMS treatment. If it is found that IMS does add extra benefit, this information will be used to help others who have Achilles pain. The exercise to stimulate healing in the tendon is likely to be uncomfortable. In fact, it has been proven that for the exercises to work best there needs to be some discomfort in the tendon. The physiotherapist will instruct participants to keep the discomfort to a level of no more than 5/10 on a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is no pain at all and 10 is the worst possible imaginable pain.  The potential risks of IMS or IMS-like (placebo) treatment are:  1. Aching/increased pain: There may be an increase in pain for one or two days, followed by an improvement in the overall pain state. This happens very commonly (50% or greater).  2. Bruising: A needle may be placed inadvertently in a blood vessel. If blood vessel is punctured with the needle, a hematoma (or bruise) will develop. This happens less commonly (5-20%).  3. Parasthesia: If a nerve is punctured, it may cause paresthesia (a prickling sensation) which may continue for days. This happens less commonly (5-20%).  4. Dizziness or faintness: Treatment may induce faintness or dizziness of a brief duration and which does not typically last beyond the time of your treatment session. This happens rarely (less than 2%).  5. Infection: This occurs any time a needle is used. For this study, sterile disposable needles will be used. This happens rarely (less than 2%).  6. Pneumothorax: When a needle is placed close to the chest wall, there is a rare possibility of pneumothorax (air in the chest cavity). This happens rarely (less than 2%).  Fortunately all these complications are not fatal and are readily reversible.

Condition

Chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy

Intervention

Current interventions as of 30/10/2012: IMS treatment group Intramuscular Stimulation (IMS) involves the insertion of fine sterile needles into tender and painful points in tight muscle bands. Treatment will be guided by the findings of the assessment, which will have paid particular attention to signs in groupings of muscles supplied by both the dorsal and ventral rami of the same segmental spinal level. Muscles in the periphery that have demonstrated tight bands or reduced muscle lengths will be treated with IMS by one of the investigators (LS). Muscles at levels of the spine that have demonstrated tight muscle bands, signs of trophedema or tender, prominent spinous processes will also be treated. The IMS group will receive treatment once a week for the first 6 weeks of the trial and once every 2 weeks for the remainder, resulting in nine treatments overall. Total treatment duration is approximately 4. 5 hours.

Sham needling The appropriate control for acupuncture or needling studies is always controversial, as the act of needling nonspecifically, even superficially, can induce a variety of physiological responses as well as a variable level of placebo response. Nonetheless, recently the importance of including both sham needling and no-treatment controls has been emphasized, and considered superior to non-penetrating placebo needles. In the sham needling group, eight acupuncture needles will be inserted into the dermis of the buttock, posterior thigh and calf and will be left in situ for ten minutes. The timing and duration of sham needling treatments is the same as the IMS treatment group arm. Total treatment duration is approximately 4. 5 hours.

Training program Both groups will undertake an exercise programme designed to initially maintain and then, as tolerated, increase the ability of the muscle-tendon unit and kinetic chain to absorb load. There will be four stages in this programme. Eccentric exercises consisting of gastrocnemius-soleus-Achilles tendon complex loading (ELE) will be incorporated at each stage. Eccentric loading has been demonstrated to be the most consistently effective conservative intervention in the treatment of mid-portion Achilles tendinosis. The program will be modeled on those developed by Alfredson and colleagues and Silbernagel and colleagues. Eccentric exercises will be prescribed in a progressive manner for the 12- week duration of the trial. Exercise progression will be as follows: two-legged very slow (Stage 1a) to slow (Stage 1b) eccentric exercise to plantargrade (on flat ground) adding load with weighted backpack or resistance equipment as available (Stage 1a progressing to Stage 1b). The next level of exercises (Stage 2) will progress to single-legged slow eccentric exercise into dorsiflexion, adding load with weighted backpack or resistance equipment as available. Further progression of loading will then be achieved by introducing speed to previously prescribed exercises using only body weight as resistance (Stage 3). Those participants who reach Stage 4 will be prescribed sports-specific exercises aimed at increasing the capacity of the muscle-tendon unit to absorb elastic loading to functional levels. Stage 1 exercises will be prescribed two to three times a day. Stage 1b exercises will be prescribed once a day, every other day. Stage 2 exercises will be prescribed every other day. Stage 3 exercises will be prescribed once a day every third day. All subjects on progression from Stage 1 to Stage 2 of the rehabilitation programme will have a scheduled rest day. On commencement of Level 2 exercises, Stage 1 and 2 level exercises will be alternated for 6 days of the week and the seventh day will be allocated as a rest day. Once Stage 3 exercises are added, Stage 1, 2 and 3 exercises will be alternated for 6 days of the week and the seventh day will be allocated as a rest day. All subjects will be entered into the rehabilitation programme at Stage 1. Subjects will be progressed based on a 24-hour response to exercise; specifically there must not be pain or stiffness the morning after undertaking the exercise. Pain during exercises will be allowed as long as it is not more than 5/10 pain on a 0 to 10 scale, where 0 is no pain at all and 10 is the worst possible imaginable pain. Through all four stages, those subjects in the IMS group and the sham needling group will be advised to rest from their ELE and exercise generally (including stretches) after their treatment for the remainder of the day and the entire next day. From Stage 2 on, this rest day will be scheduled to coincide with the day seven rest day that all groups will observe. They will be instructed to recommence their exercise program the morning after. This is standard advice given</pre>

to patients receiving IMS treatment.

All subjects will be advised that they may participate in pain-provoking activity, such as running, as long as their pain does not reach greater than 5/10 (Visual Analogue Scale) during the activity and as long as pain has returned to baseline by the following morning. The provocation of this level of pain during rehabilitation has been shown to not hinder recovery.

The exercise technique and progression will be reviewed every two weeks until 12 weeks (6 reviews total). Total treatment duration is approximately 3 hours.

Previous interventions until 30/10/2012: Training program  All three groups will undertake an eccentric exercise program consisting of gastrocnemius-soleus-Achilles tendon complex loading (ELE). Eccentric loading has been demonstrated to be the most consistently effective conservative intervention in the treatment of mid-portion Achilles tendinosis. The program will be modeled on those developed by Alfredson and colleagues and Silbernagel and colleagues. Eccentric exercises will be prescribed as three sets of 15 repetitions twice a day, both with a straight knee and a bent knee (to preferentially recruit the soleus muscle), for the 12-week duration of the trial. Exercise progression will be as follows: two-legged slow eccentric exercise to plantargrade (on flat ground) progressing to two-legged slow eccentric exercise into dorsiflexion (over a step), then to single-legged slow eccentric exercise into dorsiflexion. Further progression of loading will then be achieved by adding weights in a backpack or similar. The initial magnitude of loading prescribed will be determined by the subject s pain response to the load and ability to conduct the exercise correctly (e.g., no overpronation). Subjects who complain of pain with activities of daily living will begin with two-legged eccentric loading to plantargrade. They will progress to the next level of loading once this level no longer provokes pain. Subjects who only have pain with exercise will begin with exercises into dorsiflexion. These subjects will be placed in a loading level based on where pain is provoked, but does not cause more than 5/10 pain on a 0 to 10 scale, where 0 is no pain at all and 10 is the worst possible imaginable pain. Once this load no longer provokes a pain response, they will be progressed to the next level. Once pain can no longer be provoked before the onset of fatigue with sets of 15 repetitions, a 15-repetition maximum load will be prescribed. Those subjects in the IMS group and the sham needling group will be advised to rest from their ELE and exercise generally (including stretches) after their treatment for the remainder of the day and the entire next day. They will be instructed to recommence their exercise program the morning after. This is standard advice given to patients receiving IMS treatment. 

All subjects will be advised that they may participate in pain-provoking activity, such as running, as long as their pain does not reach greater than 5/10 (Visual Analogue Scale) during the activity and as long as pain has returned to baseline by the following morning. The provocation of this level of pain during rehabilitation has been shown to not hinder recovery.

The exercise technique and progression will be reviewed every two weeks until 12 weeks (six reviews total). At the final review a maintenance program will be provided depending on the level of loading achieved: three sets of 15 repetitions, once a day, three or four times a week. Total treatment duration is approximately 3 hours.

Primary outcome measure

Current primary outcome measures as of 11/04/2013: The primary outcome measure for which the study is powered is the 12-week VISA-A score - a well-validated and reliable disease-specific outcome measure, which also includes an activity-related pain scale. Secondary outcome measures include treatment success/failure, and muscle length (dorsiflexion ROM). Patients will rate themselves from 0 (very much worse) to 6 (very much improved). Scores of very much improved or much improved will be categorized as successes. Dorsiflexion range of motion with knee bent and straight will also be measured, giving an indication of the effect of IMS and exercise vs exercise alone on muscle extensibility. These measures will be taken at 0 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 52 weeks. At 12 weeks a follow-up UTC scan will be conducted to determine, as a pilot study, whether there is any subjective indication of a potential effect of IMS on tissue remodeling that could be pursued with a</pre>

mechanistic study in future. 

Muscle length measures will be made according to the protocol described by Norkin and White and Kendall and colleagues by a paid, experienced physiotherapist unaware of the treatment allocation. The two-joint plantarflexors (gastrocnemius and plantaris) will be measured in supine with the knee extended. The one-joint plantarflexors will also be measured in supine but with the hip and knee flexed 90 degrees or more to make the two-joint plantar flexors slack across the knee joint. The ankle will be passively dorsiflexed and the angle achieved measured by inclinometry. The fulcrum will be centred over the lateral aspect of the lateral malleolus, the proximal arm will be aligned with the lateral midline of the fibula, using the head of the fibula for reference, and the distal arm will be positioned parallel to the lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal. The ankle will be dorsiflexed to end-of-range (firmmuscular end-feel) by pushing upward across the plantar surface of the metatarsal heads, without allowing the foot to rotate into inversion or eversion. Intratester reliability in measuring passive ankle dorsiflexion by goniometry has been shown to have an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) of 0.91 for more experienced therapists.
