In patients with acute consciousness impairment and no recent seizures, does continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) correlate with reduced mortality compared with repeated routine EEG (rEEG)?

Findings

In this pragmatic, multicenter randomized clinical trial analyzing 364 adults, cEEG translated into a higher rate of seizures/status epilepticus detection and antiseizure treatment modi ications but did not improve mortality compared with rEEG.

Meaning

Pending larger studies, rEEG may represent a valid alternative to cEEG in centers with limited resources.

Abstract

Importance

In critically ill patients with altered consciousness, continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) improves seizure detection, but is resource-consuming compared with routine EEG (rEEG). It is also uncertain whether cEEG has an effect on outcome.

Objective

To assess whether cEEG is associated with reduced mortality compared with rEEG.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The pragmatic multicenter Continuous EEG Randomized Trial in Adults (CERTA) was conducted between 2017 and 2018, with follow-up of 6 months. Outcomes were assessed by interviewers blinded to interventions.The study took place at 4 tertiary hospitals in Switzerland (intensive and intermediate care units). Depending on investigators’ availability, we pragmatically recruited critically ill adults having Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 11 or less or Full Outline of Responsiveness score of 12 or less, without recent seizures or status epilepticus. They had cerebral (eg, brain trauma, cardiac arrest, hemorrhage, or stroke) or noncerebral conditions (eg, toxic-metabolic or unknown etiology), and EEG was requested as part of standard care. An independent physician provided emergency informed consent.

Interventions

Participants were randomized 1:1 to cEEG for 30 to 48 hours vs 2 rEEGs (20 minutes each), interpreted according to standardized American Clinical Neurophysiology Society guidelines.</pre>

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mortality at 6 months represented the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included interictal and ictal features detection and change in therapy.

Results

We analyzed 364 patients (33% women; mean [SD] age, 63 [15] years). At 6 months, mortality was 89 of 182 in those with cEEG and 88 of 182 in those with rEEG (adjusted relative risk [RR], 1.02; 95% CI, 0.83-1.26; P = .85). Exploratory comparisons within subgroups stratifying patients according to age, premorbid disability, comorbidities on admission, deeper consciousness reduction, and underlying diagnoses revealed no signi icant effect modi ication. Continuous EEG was associated with increased detection of interictal features and seizures (adjusted RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.08-1.15; P = .004 and 3.37; 95% CI, 1.63-7.00; P = .001, respectively) and more frequent adaptations in antiseizure therapy (RR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.12-3.00; P = .01).

Conclusions and Relevance

This pragmatic trial shows that in critically ill adults with impaired consciousness and no recent seizure, cEEG leads to increased seizure detection and modi ication of antiseizure treatment but is not related to improved outcome compared with repeated rEEG. Pending larger studies, rEEG may represent a valid alternative to cEEG in centers with limited resources.

Introduction

Electroencephalography (EEG) allows identi ication of subclinical seizures and status epilepticus (SE) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients,

 treatment adjustment under general anesthesia,  is part of prognostication after cardiac arrest,  and identi ies cerebral ischemia following subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Continuous EEG (cEEG) detects seizure activity  and nonconvulsive SE  more ef iciently than routine EEG (rEEG; 20 minutes) and is gaining increasing popularity.

 Both European Society of Intensive Care Medicine  and American Clinical Neurophysiology Society  suggest cEEG for critically ill patients with altered consciousness. However, only low-quality evidence supports these recommendations,  which may also be dif icult to apply in centers lacking human and technical resources.

There are signi icant associations between time spent with seizures or SE and worse clinical prognosis in critically ill children  and adults.  Two adult observational studies suggest that cEEG may be associated with better outcome: among 40 000 patients, lower mortality was found in those undergoing cEEG (25%) vs rEEG (39%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.52-

0.76).  Another observation on 7 million patients showed lower mortality among the 22 000 with cEEG (23%) vs no EEG or rEEG (28%; adjusted OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75-0.92) at the expense of higher costs and hospital length.  Both cross-sectional analyses were retrospective and relied on sampling from discharge diagnoses, implying potential risks of inclusion and information biases, therefore limiting conclusions on causality of associations. Indeed, other studies did not con irm these  indings: 234 patients undergoing cEEG had longer hospitalizations and more frequent anticonvulsant prescription modi ications but no mortality difference compared with controls without EEG.  Prolonged EEG did not correlate with better outcome in 29 elderly patients with nonconvulsive SE compared with 58 control patients undergoing repeated rEEG.  After cardiac arrest, cEEG prognostic yield seems similar to repeated rEEG,  with no trend toward a different outcome.

Thus, the issue of whether cEEG vs rEEG improves patients’ outcome remains controversial. This trial’s aimwas to evaluate whether cEEG is associated with reduced mortality.

Methods

Study Design

This was a Swiss multicenter (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois in Lausanne, Hôpital de Sion, Inselspital Bern, and Universitätsspital Basel), pragmatic, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the prognostic yield of cEEG, with nationally coordinated approval by local ethic commissions (project-ID 2017-00268). Inpatients older than 18 years in intensive or intermediate care units having impaired consciousness of any etiology, de ined as a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 11 or less or a Full Outline of Responsiveness (FOUR) score of 12 or less  veri ied immediately before randomization, referred from the treating team for EEG, were recruited during local investigators’ availability (working hours, not on weekends). Electroencephalogram requests re lected standard clinical practice in the participating hospitals. We excluded patients in palliative care, those risking invasive procedures within 48 hours, and those with recent seizures (36 hours) or SE (96 hours before randomization): it was determined unethical to prevent patients from cEEG to monitor refractory SE treatment. Interventions were started after written approval by a physician unrelated to patient care or the study, then written proxy consent was obtained at 7 ±3 days; written patient’s consent was sought in survivors regaining intellectual capability. Further methodologic details were previously published.  The formal trial protocols can be found in Supplement 1.

Intervention

Patients were randomized 1:1 through an online program accessible constantly to 1 cEEG or 2 rEEG, strati ied by site (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). Masking to the caring teamwas impossible owing to the intervention type; however, patients were not aware of the EEG length. All were recorded with video EEG (NicOne; Viasys Neurocare) started within 4 hours after randomization (which occurred immediately after request), using 21 to 23 electrodes following the international 10 to 20 system; reduced montages with at least 11 electrodes were possible in neurosurgical

patients,

 following technical requirements for EEG recordings in this setting.  Continuous EEG lasted 30 to 48 hours; cEEG interruptions less than 2 hours were allowed for diagnostic purposes (eg, neuroimaging). Patients randomized to rEEG had two 20- to 30-minute recordings over 48 hours (no repetition within the same day). Standardized reactivity testing with loud sounds and axial nociceptive stimulations was performed at least twice daily.

All EEG interpreters were certi ied for the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society Standardized Critical Care EEG Terminology.

 Results were communicated to treating teams within 2 hours of EEG start, at least 3 (working days) or 2 times per day (weekends and bank holidays). A uniform operational de inition of electrographic seizures (≥10 seconds) and SE (≥5 minutes) was used: repetitive, rhythmic, or periodic discharges or spike-waves at greater than 3 Hz or at less than 3 Hz with evolution in amplitude, frequency, location, or with electroclinical response to antiseizure drugs (ASD).

 The protocolled EEG intervention was stopped in patients diagnosed as having seizures or SE during the intervention period (up to 48 hours); they were subsequently treated according to best practice, allowing conversion to cEEG if needed.

Variables and Outcomes

We prospectively recorded demographics, estimated modi ied Rankin Scale (mRS) score before admission, admission reason, comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI]),  previous epileptic seizures, GCS, or FOUR immediately before EEG intervention, medication during intervention, and adverse events possibly related to intervention. Results are presented according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.

Mortality at 6 months represented the primary outcome. We assessed secondary outcomes during hospital stay and through semistructured telephone interviews with patients, relatives, or treating physicians  at 4 weeks and 6 months, blinded to intervention. They focused on:

Midazolam/propofol and ASD prescription at EEG start Seizure/SE detection Detection of interictal, potentially epileptiform features, including periodic or rhythmic patterns  (excluding generalized anterior rhythmic delta ) Modi ication of ASD or sedation (either started, stopped, increased, or decreased), triggered by the EEG results according to treating physicians, occurring over 60 hours following the beginning of the recording; not standardized (pragmatic study) Need of additional EEG after the intervention Rate of in-hospital infections requiring antibiotics Mechanical ventilation duration Time to death from randomization Hospitalization length in survivors mRS; Cerebral Performance Category (CPC)  at 6 months.

We also assessed destination after discharge, ability to return to work, and hospitalization costs; these will be the subject of subsequent studies. This trial was not designed to investigate EEG for delayed ischemia.

Statistical Analysis

We used Stata, version 14 (StataCorp). The sample size for the primary outcome was calculated using data available during the study conception: mortality in patients undergoing cEEG patients 14% lower than in those with no cEEG (25% vs 39%) ; 2 × 174 patients were needed to detect this difference (2-sided test with 0.8 power; .05 α error; χ  for independent samples). A safety interim analysis of the primary outcome was planned after 100 patients, foreseeing a study interruption if the target difference in primary outcome would have been met: in June 2018, recruitment was continued (cEEG n = 28 of 55; rEEG, n = 27 of 55; P = .85, χ ).

Analysis of secondary end points  was performed using χ , 2-sided Fisher, t, or Mann-Whitney U tests as needed. The primary outcome, assessed for patients with available data at 6 months and most relevant secondary outcomes, calculated for all patients with available data, were also assessed with risk ratios (dichotomous variables) and linear regressions (continuous variables). The relative risk (RR) for death at 6 months associated with cEEG was estimated by Poisson regression with robust error variance. For continuous variables, linear regression was performed to calculate coef icients. For exploratory purposes, regressions were adjusted for potential confounders (variables with marked asymmetry across intervention groups despite randomization). We also explored the primary outcome in subgroups of patients with the most prevalent neurologic diagnoses, and patients with deeper consciousness impairment (FOUR ≤10 or GCS ≤8). Therefore, interaction terms were  it to the regression models evaluating relative death risks at 6 months and use of cEEG, to assess effect modi ication by age, mRS, CCI, hypoxic- ischemic encephalopathy, brain trauma, and intracranial hemorrhage. Signi icance was set at P  = .05, with 2-sided approaches.

Results

Between April 2017 and November 2018, we recruited 402 patients; 6 were excluded before intervention (5 double inclusions and 1 death) and 28 during or shortly thereafter (27 proxy or post hoc consent refusals and 1 double inclusion); 183 participants in the rEEG and 185 in the cEEG were available for outcome assessments. Four patients were lost to follow-up, resulting in 182 participants in each arm available for the primary outcome at 6 months (Figure 1). All patients received the EEG intervention to which they were randomized. No adverse event related to EEG procedures was observed.

Table 1 summarizes baseline characteristics; intervention groups appeared globally balanced, but patients receiving rEEG tended to have a lower burden of comorbidities, less prevalent hypoxic- ischemic encephalopathy and brain trauma, and more prevalent ischemic stroke, toxic metabolic disorders, and other conditions (infections, in lammations, oncological, and/or degenerative).

Median EEG duration was in line with the protocol (40 minutes for rEEG [2 × 20 minutes]; 32 hours for cEEG). No relevant difference was observed across centers for demographics, anoxic- ischemic encephalopathy, and time to EEG (data not shown).

Table 2 illustrates outcomes at 6 months. Mortality did not differ across intervention groups and centers (Le Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois: n = 147 of 287; other hospitals, n = 40 of 97; P = .91; χ ). This did not change after adjusting for CCI and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy nor after exploratory strati ication for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (eTable in Supplement 2), or age, baseline mRS, CCI, traumatic brain injury, intracranial hemorrhage, severity of consciousness impairment, or time to EEG (Figure 2). Limiting analysis to survivors, CPC did not change across groups, while mRS evolution at 6 months was better in the rEEG group, especially in patients without hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy; eFigure 2 in Supplement 2 shows the distribution of functional outcomes.

Table 3 outlines exploratory secondary outcomes according to intention-to-monitor during the EEG intervention (if an rEEG was converted to cEEG and the patient quit intervention; results of the latter and subsequent treatment were not counted for this analysis). Detection of features of ictal-interictal continuum, seizures, and/or SE were more frequent in the cEEG group, as was the modi ication rate of ASD prescription; conversely, sedatives, need for EEG after intervention, infections, mechanical ventilation duration, time to death since randomization, and survivors’ length of stay did not differ. To explore whether cEEG facilitated decisions of life-sustaining treatment withdrawal, we further analyzed death latency, which was comparable in the subgroup with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (rEEG: median, 8.5 days; range, 0-156; cEEG: median, 6 days; range, 0-157; P = .07) and without (rEEG: median, 11 days; range, 1-130; cEEG: median, 8 days; range 1-176; P = .40; U tests).

Discussion

To our knowledge, this represents the  irst randomized clinical trial in this clinical setting. It reveals similar long-termmortality in critically ill adults with altered consciousness without recent seizures randomized to repeated rEEG or cEEG, despite higher detection of ictal and interictal EEG features and ASD modi ications in those receiving cEEG.

Patients were recruited following a quantitative de inition of consciousness impairment, unlike previous observations.

 Additionally, they were assessed for comorbidities and estimated disability before intervention, allowing evolution characterization over 6 months. This represents a reasonable estimation of long-term outcome, unlike mortality at discharge reported previously.



In our view, the principal  inding is corroborated by adjustment for imbalances in baseline characteristics despite randomization, exploration of potential effects of demographics and etiologies, and comparable latency to death in both interventions. Median cEEG recording (32 hours) may appear shorter than the usual duration in some centers, but is longer than a retrospective evaluation from 3 large US hospitals  and in line with a 2018 Dutch survey ; as opposed to that assessment, all our recordings had concomitant video. Notably, the 2 discharge- based studies did not report on cEEG duration  and 93% of seizures seem to be detectable within 24 to 48 hours.

Overall mortality (48.6%) was higher than in the 2 retrospective observations (22% and 39% ), possibly re lecting enrollment of 30.7% hypoxic-ischemic patients, a condition related to 50%mortality. Also, exclusion from analysis (per Swiss law) of survivors subsequently withdrawing patient consent in lated our mortality rate (mortality would have been 45.4% considering these 26 patients). Because previous studies do not detail on diagnoses, direct comparisons are impossible. Additionally, those studies assessed mortality at discharge, potentially underestimating it at 6 months. Finally, a randomized study appears different from retrospective assessments of discharge diagnoses.

Mortality in patients without cardiac arrest showed a nonsigni icant trend favoring cEEG: the absolute difference of 4.5% lies at less than the targeted 14% but is similar to the 5% reported in the 2019 retrospective assessment.  This might orient on the sample size needed for a future trial, where a difference of 4% (for example, a decrease from 48% to 44%) would imply enrollment of 4872 analyzable patients without cardiac arrest (2-sided proportion test; P = .05; power = 0.8). The fact that disability (mRS) evolved more favorably in survivors without cardiac arrest undergoing rEEG seems to counterbalance the mortality tendency.

This trial con irms that cEEG leads to increased detection of ictal and interictal EEG features than rEEG, even excluding patients with recent seizures or SE. The rEEG detection rate (4.4% over 40 minutes) represents roughly one-quarter of cEEG (15.7% over 32 hours in median); the latter is comparable with literature data from the past few years (2017-2019),

 also including patients after cardiac arrest, and suggests reasonable generalizability of our  indings. The observational cEEG study identi ied ictal changes in 12.3% to 13.6%,  the meta-analysis in 6.3% of rEEG and 15.6% of cEEG.  The pooled prevalence of repetitive or rhythmic features of the ictal-interictal continuum, excluding generalized rhythmic delta, was between 28% to 29% in 3 US centers  and 4% to 9% for rEEG and 7% to 15% for cEEG in the meta-analysis.  These broad proportions appear lower than ours (55.7% for rEEG and 69.2% for cEEG), possibly following inclusion of sporadic epileptiform features in our labeling, and maybe higher assessment accuracy; all our interpreters were American Clinical Neurophysiology Society certi ied, strengthening external validity.

One-third of patients received ASD at EEG start, re lecting prophylaxis following brain trauma and the fact that about 10% of participants had previous seizures (before the timeframe de ined as exclusion criterium). Antiseizure drug prescription was modi ied more frequently in the cEEG arm, likely following the re ined diagnosis of interictal and ictal changes compared with rEEG. The modi ication rate (21%; 28% if including changes in sedation) appears lower than reported in previous observational studies.

 However, those modi ications occurred during the entire hospitalization, as opposed to our time restriction over the  irst 60 hours after EEG start and the de inition of association with EEG results, which should better (although more conservatively) re lect the effect of the EEG intervention.

Improved diagnostics and increased modi ication in ASD do not seem to translate into better clinical outcome (not only mortality but also functional) nor different hospitalization length in survivors. One possible explanation is that EEG may trigger decisions to life-sustaining treatment withdrawal. This would rather involve both arms (background is the most informative feature in

this context ). Mortality and mRS evolution in survivors were actually not different between intervention groups considering patients with cardiac arrest (where EEG is an integral part of these decisions ); furthermore, previous studies did not show any mortality difference in this particular diagnosis across EEG durations.

 Also, although unfortunately we do not have information on death causes, death latency was relatively similar across EEG types in the whole cohort (median: 1 week after intervention); a massive effect of active withdrawal seems unlikely. Another potential explanation may involve underlying cerebral structural damage independently from the additional role played by epileptic phenomena. As illustrated for patients with SE, successful treatment of electrical dysfunction may be futile if the effects of initial structural injury are predominant.

 This might suggest that underlying variables not related to epileptic aspects may represent additional important determinants of prognosis in this setting.

Need of subsequent EEG after the intervention was not signi icantly higher in cEEG, possibly re lecting a higher seizure and SE detection rate. Sedation at baseline was comparable across groups and globally given at relatively low dosage, and EEG-triggered changes were minor; duration of mechanical ventilation did not differ.

Limitations

This study has limitations. Our sample size is based on the only available comparison at the time of design (2015-2016), and analysis of several secondary outcomes may have been underpowered. We enrolled patients with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy having a high mortality risk. However, they represent one of the most frequent ICU neurologic diagnoses,  and some previous observational cEEG studies also included them.

 As mentioned, a considerably larger patient sample without this condition may allow detecting small outcome differences. We did not record the start of altered consciousness, but EEG was performed within 4 hours after request (see Methods). The time of EEG intervention since hospital admission may seem relatively long, but restricting analysis to patients admitted less than a week ago does not change the results. We pragmatically studied a referral cohort. There was unfortunately no screening of all potential candidates (recruitment occurred only during working hours); we recognize that this may represent a selection bias. In addition, many patients received sedation at baseline, which may reduce seizure detection, but doses were globally low and comparable across groups. Although suboptimal, this re lects clinical routine; the similarities of our cEEG seizure detection rates to previous studies seem to corroborate our  indings’ generalizability. The cohort is heterogeneous in terms of etiologies, but inclusion criteria closely  it current recommendations. We assessed the relation of mortality with a diagnostic test, not a treatment. However, EEG results were provided regularly and timely, translating into changes in clinical management. We excluded patients having seizures or SE immediately before enrollment, potentially lowering the EEG yield, but it seems that cEEGs ordered to monitor already-diagnosed SE represent a minority of requests in clinical practice.  Our  indings are not generalizable to ICU patients with incident seizures or SE, in whom cEEG is commonly used for treatment monitoring. The protocol foreseeing communication to the caregivers several times per day, and recording durations of at least 30 hours, corresponds to clinical practice and actually lies beyond current recommendations.

Considering these limitations, despite increased detection rates of interictal and ictal features and of EEG-driven modi ication of antiseizure therapy, cEEG does not seem to correlate with improved patient outcome compared with repeated rEEG. Pending larger studies in a more homogeneous patient population, repeated rEEG may represent a reasonable alternative to cEEG, at least in centers with limited resources.

Study Description

Brief Summary:

Continuous video-EEG monitoring (cEEG) significantly improves seizure or status epilepticus detection in patients in intensive care units (ICUs), and is recommended for patients with consciousness impairment. cEEG is time- and resource consuming as compared to routine EEG (rEEG, lasting 20-30 minutes). While centers in North America have

been using it increasingly, most European hospitals still do not have resources to comply with these guidelines. In addition, only one population-based study based on discharge diagnoses suggested that cEEG may improve patients' outcome. Current guidelines are thus based upon weak evidence and expert opinions.

Aim of the study is to assess if cEEG in adults with consciousness impairment is related to an improvement of functional outcome, and to address the prognostic role of quantitative network EEG analyses.

In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, adults with GCS inferior or equal to 11 or FOUR score inferior or equal to 12 will be randomized 1:1 to cEEG for 30-48 hours or two rEEG within 48 hours. The primary outcome will be mortality at 6 months. Secondary outcomes will blindly assess functional outcome, seizure/status epilepticus detection rate, duration of ICU stay, change in patient management (antiepileptic drug introduced, increased, or stopped, brain imaging), and reimbursement. Additionally, quantitative EEG will be assessed towards the primary outcome. 350 patients are planned to be included.

Detailed Description:

Background: Continuous video-EEG monitoring (cEEG) is a non-invasive tool to monitor the electrical brain function; it significantly improves seizure or status epilepticus detection in comatose patients in intensive care units (ICUs), which o en do not show any specific clinical correlates. Recently, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine published guidelines regarding the use of cEEG in the ICUs, recommending it for most patients with consciousness disorders. cEEG is time- and resource consuming as compared to routine spot EEG (rEEG, typically lasting 20-30 minutes). While centers in North America have been using it increasingly, most European - and all Swiss - hospitals still do not have enough resources to comply with these guidelines. In addition, while the superiority of cEEG to detect non-convulsive seizures or status epilepticus is proven, only one population-based study based on discharge diagnoses suggested that cEEG may improve patients' outcome. Current guidelines are thus based upon weak evidence and expert opinions. If cEEG leads to improved patients' care remains elusive. Moreover, little attention has been drawn towards quantitative EEG information beyond visual analysis, and the impact of such information on diagnosis, treatment, and outcome remains unclear.

Aim: To assess whether the use of cEEG in patients with consciousness impairment is related to an improvement of functional outcome, and to address the prognostic role of quantitative network EEG analyses in this cohort. Also, a cost analysis will be performed.

Methods: In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, adults with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) inferior or equal to 11 or a FOUR score inferior or equal to 12, regardless of etiologies, will be randomized 1:1 to cEEG for 30-48 hours or</pre>

two rEEG within 48 hours, interpreted in a standardized way. Patients with detected seizures in the last 36h or status epilepticus in the last 96h will be excluded, as cEEG may represent the standard of care. Demographics, etiology, Charlson Comorbidity Index, GCS, diagnosis leading to EEG, mechanical ventilation, and subsequent use of rEEG/cEEG will be collected. The primary outcome will be mortality at 6 months. Secondary outcomes will blindly assess functional outcome at 4 weeks and 6 months, as well as seizure/status epilepticus detection rate and time to detection, infections rate, duration of ICU stay, change in patient management (antiepileptic drug introduced, increased, or stopped, brain imaging), and reimbursement. Analyses will compare the two interventional groups (intention to diagnose) regarding outcome, as a whole and stratified according to etiological subgroups, and other variables of interest. Additionally, lope cross correlation and horizontal visibility graphs will be applied to compute a weighted adjacency matrix consisting of all the pairwise interdependences between EEG signals, in order to characterize the integrative and segregative characteristics of the underlying functional brain networks and compare their relationship with the primary outcome. According to a previous estimate, patients with consciousness disorders undergoing cEEG have a 75% survival rate; while patients w/o cEEG 61%. Using a power of 0.8, an α error of 0.05, and a 2-side approach, 2x174 patients would be needed to detect this significant diﬀerence in survival.

Expected impact: This study will clarify if cEEG monitoring has a significant impact on functional outcome and define its cost eﬀectiveness, and if network EEG analysis has a role in outcome prognostication. The results of this study will have a considerable potential to influence clinical practice regarding EEG and treatment of patients with altered levels of consciousness. If results will indicate that cEEG contributes to improve outcome, this will lead to the urgent need for implementation of cEEG with consecutive substantial impact on health care and resource allocation in larger Swiss and European hospitals.

Intervention/treatment 

Experimental: continuous EEG (cEEG)

Patients randomized to continuous EEG will be recorded with at least 21 electrodes placed according to the international 10-20 system; occasionally, a reduced montage will be allowed in patients with extensive neurosurgical scars, according to good common practice. Recordings will last a minimum of 30 and a maximum of 48 hours. During this time, one interruption to a maximum of two hours for diagnostic purposes will be allowed. Reactivity testing using auditory and nociceptive stimuli will be performed at least twice during the recording time. Recordings will be visually interpreted by certified electroencephalographers (i.e., interpretation of the automated algorithm only won't be allowed) using the 2013 American Clinical neurophysiology nomenclature; interpretations will be communicated within two hours of their completion to the treating team.
